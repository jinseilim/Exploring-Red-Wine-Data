## Analyzing Wine Quality

Exploratory data analysis in R for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The ultimate goal was to uncover the variables most correlated with wine quality, as judged by tasters. 

- wineQualityReds.csv is the dataset. 

- RedWine.docx explains the variables in the dataset. 

- RedWine.rmd is the R markdown file containing my analysis. 

- RedWine.html is the knitted R markdown file in HTML format.
